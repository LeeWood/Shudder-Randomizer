## Notes

- The search format for each title to get an accurate first google result is shudder.com>movies>watch>movie-title-here.
- This seems to work every time, with the first google search result being the link to the actual watch file of the title! 
- I need to find out if there's a way to make a function that both searches google and then follows with selecting and loading the first result of a search page...
